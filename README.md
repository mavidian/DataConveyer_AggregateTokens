# DataConveyer_AggregateTokens

DataConveyer_AggregateTokens is a console application to demonstrate how Data Conveyer can be
used to accumulate data extracted from a sequence of input files.

There are 10 sample XML files located in ...Data folder. Data Conveyer will process all these
files and identify tokens contained in them (in this example, tokens are just XML nodes named *Token*). The
 contents of these tokens will be accumulated and saved in a CSV file.
